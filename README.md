# About

This was a school project on a Tic Tac Toe. The initial functions were already written and we had to complete the program.

# Required software

• An IDE for the Python language.

# Installation

***The commands to type only in the console***

Place a piece : **pose_pion("Player number", "Horizontal coordinate", "Vertical coordinate")**

If the square is playable : **case_jouable("Horizontal coordinate", "Vertical coordinate")** "The coordinates of the square must be between 0 and 2 and the square must be empty".

Know who is the winning player if the game is over : **joueur_gagnant()**

You can display the tic-tac-toe board by typing this command in the console : **affiche_tableau_de_jeu()**

***For more context:***

PLAYERS = ('O', 'X') | 

'O' = 0 and 'X' = 1
